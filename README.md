LILAC and LNR Polar Bear Plunge
======================================

I created a one-page site for LILAC Cancer Support and Lough Neagh Rescue's Annual Polar Bear Plunge. It was used for the New Year's Day Plunge 2017 and 2018.

They have recently changed their media strategy and the site is no longer needed, so I have rehosted it here for my portfolio.
